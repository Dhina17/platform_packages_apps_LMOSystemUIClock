# LMOSystemUIClock

LMOSystemUIClock is the default AOSP clock plugin but with different font styles.

## Build and Installation
- You can build this project easily with Android Studio.
- For testing, your device's Android version should match the plugin version.
  For example, the `fifteen-qpr1` branch will support devices running Android 15 QPR1 only.
- **Note:** This plugin should be signed with the platform key.
- In Android Studio, it will be signed with the AOSP test platform key by default.
